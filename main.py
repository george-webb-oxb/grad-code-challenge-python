# Graduate Coding Challenge - Python

# Here are a series of small coding challeneges in cpp for you to try!
# There is no right or wrong answer, just give it a go!

# Don't worry about not finishing it.
# Don't google a solution to the questions!
# You can search for small things like "what does this function return".

# Leave all the code you write, even the debug stuff :)!
# Just comment it out if you need to run the app.

# Each question has a URL to an explanation of what we are asking :)

# Python -> You shouldn't need to import anything but you can import
# standard libray stuff if you need.
# Replit -> You can edit what happens when you hit run in the .replit file

# Have fun!

import unordered_numbers as data

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Write a function that takes in a vector of unordered numbers
#    (unordered_numbers.h) and returns a vectors of ordered numbers 
#    (ascending order) using a merge sort. 
#    DON'T USE std::sort!! (that makes it too easy)

# 2. Write a function to show your sorting works on your ordered numbers
#    (e.g. Prints "Passed" to the terminal on an expected result).

# 3. Write a function that performs a binary search to return 
#    the index of a given number (if it exists!).

# (Try not to read the sudo code at the end of the page....)

# 4. Write a function to show your binary search works 
#    (e.g. Prints "Passed" to the terminal on an expected result).
